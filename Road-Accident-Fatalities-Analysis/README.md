# üö® Road Accident Analysis - Tableau Assignment 3

This repository contains the **Road Accident Analysis** project developed using **Tableau** to explore patterns, causes, safety measures, and emergency response trends associated with road accidents.

The objective is to derive **actionable insights** and **visual storytelling** from road accident data using interactive dashboards and visualizations to support policy-making and safety enhancements.

## üìå Assignment Overview

The analysis includes the following major tasks:

- **Task 1: Handling Missing Values**  
  Replacing N/A values in the ‚ÄúHelmet Used‚Äù column with "Unknown" to ensure data completeness.

- **Task 2: Road Accident Trends Over Time**  
  Analyzing how accident occurrences have changed over time using line charts.

- **Task 3: Impact of Weather Conditions on Accidents**  
  Heatmap visualization to study the effect of various weather conditions on accident frequencies.

- **Task 4: Compare Accidents with and without Safety Measures**  
  Comparing fatality and injury rates based on seat belt and helmet usage.

- **Task 5: Fatality Rates by Road Type and Speeding**  
  Using a Tree Map to visualize fatality rates by road type and analyze speeding as a factor.

- **Task 6: Emergency Response Time Analysis (Using Parameters)**  
  Parameterized threshold to classify emergency responses into "Fast" or "Delayed" and analyze fatalities using bar charts.

- **Task 7: Road Accident Story**  
  A complete Tableau Story presenting key findings, insights, and recommendations for decision-makers.
