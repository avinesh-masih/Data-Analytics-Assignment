## üè¢ About the Company

**GlamourGlow Cosmetics** is a rapidly growing beauty brand operating via a hybrid B2C and B2B model.

## üìå Problem Statement

Despite strong growth, GlamourGlow faces critical supply chain challenges:

- **Inventory Imbalance** ‚Äì Overstocking and stockouts occur simultaneously due to poor inventory visibility.

- **Fulfillment Lags** ‚Äì Late deliveries are not effectively tracked.
- **Cost Escalation** ‚Äì Rising freight and fuel charges impact profit margins.
